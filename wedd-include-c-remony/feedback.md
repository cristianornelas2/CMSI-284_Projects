| **System Call Me Maybe** | |
| The Frank (Serious) One | |
| • _Assembles, links, and runs without unexpected errors?_ Assembles, links, and appears to run successfully.<br><br>However, requires _ld_ as the linker, and this prevents access to command-line arguments (–1). | 1/2 |
| • _Correct system call invocation (`syscall`)?_ System call appears to be invoked correctly. | 3/3 |
| • _Correct program output or result?_ Program appears to work as intended. | 8/8 |
| • _Correct handling of invalid user input or erroneous results?_ Program is hardcoded and does not accept any user input (–1). | 1/2 |
| The Prank (Combo) One | |
| • _Well-described expected behavior?_ Description of expected behavior not found; had to be inferred from code (–2). | 1/3 |
| • _Assembles, links, and runs without unexpected errors?_ Assembles, links, and appears to run successfully.<br><br>However, requires _ld_ as the linker, and this prevents access to command-line arguments (–1). | 1/2 |
| • _Correct _multiple_ system call invocations (`syscall`)?_ Multiple system calls appear to be invoked correctly, but two (`write` and `exit`) is off-limits, per the assignment instructions (–2). | 3/5 |
| • _Correct program output or result?_ Program appears to work as intended. | 10/10 |
| • _Correct handling of invalid user input or erroneous results?_ Program accepts input but does not do any error checking (–2). | 3/5 |
| _Insufficiently-commented instructions?_ Instruction-level comments are provided in _Serious.asm_ only (–2) | -2 |
| **Hard-to-maintain or error-prone code** No major error-prone or maintainability issues found. |  |
| **Hard-to-read code** No major readability issues found. |  |
| **Version Control** 21 commits; good commit frequency and granularity, but commit messages could have been a little more descriptive.  |  |
